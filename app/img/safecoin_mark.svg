<desc>SAFEcoin Symbol @100 base units

Basic shape is that of a Hexagon 

The unit size of the image is the radial length of the hexagon and set to 100.0000  All other points
have been calculated from this.

The two halves are identical with different colours and one is rotated in relation to the other
in order to form the hexagon shape.

NOTE: - These points have been recalculated from the previous version which had numereous extra points 
        and errors.  It would appear this was the result of the version before that being editted using
	    a graphics program
