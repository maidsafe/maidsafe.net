  <p class="al-p">
    Within the alpha there are no hosting costs and the Demo App makes it very easy to upload existing
    websites, or even create your own! There is no centralised DNS to ask permission to name and
    identify your site, or your own public identity.

  <p class="al-p">
    The Demo App enables everyone to securely store private data that only you can read.*
    Any data uploaded to the SAFE Network is split into chunks, randomised, encrypted and stored across
    several nodes on the network using a process called <a href="./features.html#self-encryption">Self-Encryption</a>. With the SAFE Network, your
    files never leave your computer unencrypted!

  <h4 class="al-sub-title">One login for all your apps.</h4>
  <p class="al-p">
    Using the Authenticator you can securely authenticate all your apps with just one set of credentials. Your
    login details are never passed to authorised apps keeping you secure and in control of all your information.
