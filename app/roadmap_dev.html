  <h3>Development Roadmap</h3>
  <p>
    The purpose of this roadmap is to provide a snap shot of the SAFE Network
    planned release process, MaidSafe’s development progress and the current
    set of features that are available to both end users and developers. For
    a more detailed picture, you can <a href="roadmap.html">view the full roadmap</a>

    <h3 class="title">The release process</h3>
    <p class="p">
      The purpose of the development roadmap is to provide an indication of the
      SAFE Network’s up and coming features. There are no timescales at this
      stage as the speed at which MaidSafe will iterate through the alpha
      testing stage is unknown and is dependent upon how well the network
      performs during testing. However, it is anticipated that
      having the core network in place will make it signiﬁcantly easier to test
      the addition of new features than ever before. It may become possible to
      be more speciﬁc with timescales as we enter beta phase.
    </p>
    <h4 class="sub-title">The main phases of the release process are:</h4>
    <ul class="list bullet-1">
      <li>Alpha – the core network and fundamental functionality is provided via an initial implementation, this is the first public testing phase.</li>
      <li>Beta – alpha implementations are reiterated and improved, based on user feedback.</li>
      <li>Release candidate – the fundamental feature set is stabilised to provide greater security, resilience and efficiency.</li>
      <li>Release – privacy, security, freedom!</li>
    </ul>

      to developers.
