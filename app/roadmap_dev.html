  <h3>Development Roadmap</h3>
  <p>
    The purpose of the development roadmap is to provide an indication 
    of the SAFE Networkâ€™s release history, rollout strategy, as well as 
    our near term development focus.

            The core network and fundamental functionality is provided via an initial 
            implementation. This is the first public testing phase.

            <h3>Future Roadmap</h3>
            <p>
              Our immediate development focus (alpha 2) is to provide Mutable Data and authenticator pattern
              (with the new SAFE API) SAFE Browser DOM APIs and Node.js SDK along with example apps, tutorials
              and documentation. This new data type and API paradigm is specifically catered for mobile platform support.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our focus with Alpha 3 (Secure Autonomous Network) is an autonomous secure routing layer that will integrate the first part of 
              <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/maidsafe/rfcs/blob/master/text/0029-data-chains.md/0029-data-chains.md">data chains</a> and 
              <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/maidsafe/rfcs/blob/master/text/0045-node-ageing/0045-node-ageing.md">node ageing</a>, 
              enabling users to run routing nodes. This network will provide secure transient data and will be well suited to facilitating secure messaging apps.
            </p>
            <p>
              During Alpha 4 we will incorporate the data layer through the reintroduction of user run vaults. The data 
              element is much more straightforward after the secure routing layer is in place and this will facilitate 
              a much broader range of decentralised apps.
            </p>
            <p>There will be many testnets between alpha networks and looking beyond alpha 4 we will focus on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Data republish and network restarts.</li>
              <li>A security audit of the network.</li>
              <li>Test safecoin.</li>
              <li>Real-time network upgrades.</li>
              <li>Network validated upgrades.</li>
            </ul>
