      <h3>Who we are</h3>
      <p>
        Started in 2006 by Scottish engineer David Irvine, MaidSafe is a small team, comprised of: thinkers, inventors,
        tinkerers, PHDs, engineers and designers. Although based in Troon, Scotland, we have drawn talents from many
        different cultures and countries, reflecting the users that we serve. Despite this variety, we all share a
        mission: a desire to provide security and privacy for everyone.

      <h3>What drives us</h3>
      <p>
        MaidSafe's aim is to provide privacy, security and freedom to everyone on the planet. This has been our
        unwavering ambition since we started on this journey in 2006, and it remains our driving force today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Online data has become so insecure and data thefts so commonplace that our trust in companies securing our
        data is almost entirely eroded. An estimated 1.1 billion personal and sensitive records were stolen during
        2014 with 8 incidents reported every single day. A new way of managing data is required, and MaidSafe combines
        several features that we believe provide a level of security not possible using existing methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data security not only allows us to keep our credit card details safe, or our medical records secure, but only
        with security do we achieve privacy. Privacy is misunderstood by many. Too often people believe that demanding
        privacy is identical to protecting secrets, or hiding something that we shouldn’t be doing. Some would have us
        believe that, in some way, by not wanting to share everything with the world, we are involved in an unlawful act.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in truth, this is not what privacy is about. Privacy is simply the ability to choose which personal thoughts,
        communications and actions you wish to share with others. Without privacy one's ability to communicate,
        explore, act or even think freely is restrained. Only in an environment of adequate privacy can creativity, new
        ideas and forms of expression flourish.
