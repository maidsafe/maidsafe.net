        <p>
            MaidSafe would like to thank the following companies who have either provided their services free of charge or
            at a reduced cost on the basis that the SAFE network is open source. Collaboration is one of the many benefits
            of working within the open source community and it is great that these companies, while proprietary themselves,
            have embraced this spirit.
