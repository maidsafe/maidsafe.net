    quote: "David laid the foundation for MaidSafe which was something that was a conceptual impossibility to me before I joined so I was intrigued by the scale of it. I decided to relocate to Troon from India as for me it helps being at HQ to co-ordinate and manage the project. When I am face to face with people in front of a whiteboard this helps to solve issues quickly and also helps me to understand the more technical aspects of the project especially at nascent stages. The latter was something I cared about the most."

    quote: "Many times in big corporations you are just a number, so a startup gives you a different perspective. We are here coding an open source project and your work gets a lot of visibility - people start using what you develop in a matter of few days, start seeing your code, can ask for your help, etc. I'm also able to combine two big passions, software development and travelling."

    quote: "The Rust language is very interesting, challenging language and Maidsafe’s use of it shows that the company is forward-thinking and adopts new technology. MaidSafe is also forward-thinking in having remote workers as it means that I don’t have to relocate. From the SAFE network and community I got the sense that this is a very important project and I wanted to have the chance to contribute."

    quote: "I was compelled to work with MaidSafe when I saw that they were working with Rust and that it could be an opportunity for me to learn systems programming. David's blog, https://metaquestions.me/, where I began reading about  the network architecture really confirmed for me that it would be amazing to create a career out of learning this stuff.",
